# bikesharing
Module 14

## Overview
We are reviewing City bikesharing data from New York City to see if this business model is possible in Des Moines.  We are reviewing bikesharing data for total rides in the month of August.  This data is broken out for times of day, gender and length of rides.


## Results
Our data is collected for the month of August. We can see various charts that show the outcome for total, time used, gender and length of ride

### Total Number of Rides
We can see the total number of Rides for the month of August.

### August Peak Hours
We can see the Peak Hours for August are primarily during the evening commute, between 5:00 - 7:00 pm. It is also quite busy during the morning commute around 8:00 am

### Average Trip Duration by Age
We can see there are some outliers in the data with Birth Years prior to 1920.  But in general you can see the graph inching up with Birth Years since 1990 - indicating that younger people are more likely to use the bikeshare program.

### Checkout Times for Users
We can see that the majority of bike checkouts throughout All hours have a minimal checkout time, between 0 and 20 minutes.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
Once again, we can see that the majority of bike checkouts are during the morning and evening commute times, Monday through Friday.  We can also see that there is pretty steady use on Saturdays.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
This shows a similar pattern of heavy commuter checkout times.  The pattern is consistent between Male and Female Riders, but again shows a much larger use by Males.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
We also reviewed a breakdown by One-time customer use and Subscription users.  It shows there is a large amount of demand for Subscription users, that are Male.  Their heaviest checkouts are Monday through Friday, but are also used a lot on weekends as well.

### Dashboard
We put our primary information into a Dashboard, to be used in the Story later.  We wanted to capture Total number of Rides and a breakdown of weekly ride data.

### Story
Our analysis came together in the Story.  We used the Dashboard to open the story, followed by all the primary charts for our analysis.

## Summary
Overall, our data shows that there is a high amount of bikeshare usage during the prime morning and evening commuter hours.  These bikes are primarily used by Males with Subscriptions. 

Additional analysis should include:
- Cost for Bikesharing Subscriptions - cost per ride
- Cost breakout for Gender - cost per ride
